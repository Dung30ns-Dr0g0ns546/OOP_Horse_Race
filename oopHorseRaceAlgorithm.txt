# Data
create a void "forward"
create a void "getPosition"
create a void "printLane" and add ints "position" and "name"

create a Horse class
have "position" as private class
add "getPosition" to horse
make "setPosition" int
add "forward" int with "position" int as variable
add "coinFlip" variable
add all data to public class


create a Race class
have "Horse race[5]" as private class
make "length" int
make "Race" with "length" int as variable

add "printLane" with ints "position" and "name" as variables
